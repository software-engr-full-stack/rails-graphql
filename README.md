# A simple GraphQL server app

I built this app to learn about GraphQL.

# Usage

1. Clone this repo

2. `cd` into the clone directory

3. `bundle`

4. `rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`

5. `rails server` This will run the server on port 3000 in the foreground.

6. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000/graphiql](http://localhost:3000/graphiql)
